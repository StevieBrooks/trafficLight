# trafficLight
One of the traffic light systems where I live is a nightmare. I mean, only an idiot would have programmed it. So with my ten minutes of Javascript experience (and a bit too much ego), I convinced myself that I could do a better job. I haven't even come close. This is my first JS project and I was lucky to complete a single traffic light, and it still isn't perfect.
